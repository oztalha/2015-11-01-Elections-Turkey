This notebook contains some maps and plots regarding the last two general election results in Turkey (held in Jun 7, 2015 and Nov 1, 2015).

## Data Source
Both Jun 7 and Nov 1 election results are scraped from the Nov 1, 2015 [election results page]('http://www.yenisafak.com/secim-2015-kasim/secim-sonuclari') of the Yenisafak daily. You can find them as CSV files in the data folder.

## Election Results Maps
I created two maps for the last two general election results of Turkey. If you click on any of the cities in those maps (below) vote shares of the four parties are shown for that particular election.

The colors in these maps represent the vote share of AKP in those cities. Since one of the more interesting questions regarding the Nov 1, 2015 election is in which cities AKP increased its votes, I created density maps to facilitate us seeing them.

## Vote Share Scatter Plots of Each Party per City for the Last Two Elections
For all of the parties, their vote shares in the last two elections is compared in a scatter plot where the dots represent the cities and their colors represent the geographic region they belong to. One interesting pattern for example is that unlike other parties, CHP increased its vote share in some cities and lost some in others. On the other hand we see that AKP increased its vote share in every city, whereas MHP and HDP lost their shares almost in every single city.
